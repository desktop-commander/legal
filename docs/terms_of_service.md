**Last Updated: January 20, 2026**

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Desktop Commander SIA ("Desktop Commander," "we," or "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Desktop Commander's software, platform, APIs, documentation, website https://desktopcommander.app, and related tools (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

Please also read our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, disclose, and process personal data.

## Definitions

The Service includes the following products:

- **"Desktop Commander MCP"** – Our open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, released under the MIT license and available at https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP. Your use of Desktop Commander MCP is governed by the MIT license, which takes precedence over these Terms where applicable.

- **"Desktop Commander App"** – Our desktop application for macOS, Windows, and Linux, which provides a graphical interface and includes embedded MCP functionality.

- **"Desktop Commander Remote"** – Our cloud-based service for remote device execution, requiring account registration and enabling authenticated connections between devices.

- **"Website"** – https://desktopcommander.app and related web properties.

Where these Terms conflict with an applicable open-source license (such as the MIT license for Desktop Commander MCP), the open-source license governs your use of that component.
