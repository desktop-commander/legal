### Blog

If a change is material, we will provide reasonable advance notice (for example, by posting a notice in the Service or by email) and indicate when the change takes effect. Non-material changes may take effect upon posting. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date means this Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Service.
